# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 2025-11-14  
Application Name: PKSToolsSuiteV13 (Integrated Tool Suite)  
Main Executable: PKSToolsSuiteV13  
Contact: xueliang.zhang@honeywell.com

This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected, used, stored, and protected when you use this desktop tool suite (“Software”). If you do not agree with this Policy, please discontinue use.

---

## 1. Scope
This Policy covers the integrated tool interface launched from PKSToolsSuiteV13 and all included tabs/features (e.g., CNF Analyzer, Batch Excel Creation, Excel Comparison, Linear Curve, AlarmGroup Cleaning, Station Screenshot).

This Policy does not cover:
- Any modified, repackaged, or unofficial distribution of the Software.
- Independent data practices of third-party scripts/libraries you may use.
- Data collected by your operating system, Python runtime, or other independent software.

---

## 2. Data Minimization Principle
The Software is designed for local/offline processing:
- It does not automatically upload, sync, or remotely transmit the contents of files you select.
- It does not include cloud account sign-in, advertising, or remote analytics tracking.
- It does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information (PII), unless such information is embedded by you in processed files or inputs.

---

## 3. Data Types Potentially Processed
Only after your explicit action (selecting files/folders/paths), the Software locally parses or temporarily holds in memory:
1. CNF XML file content (structures, modules, parameter references, connection relationships).
2. Excel file content (cell data necessary for batch creation or comparison).
3. Text you input in the UI (e.g., tool description updates, changelog notes).
4. Generated summary data during export (analysis statistics, reference lists).
5. Images generated by the screenshot feature (saved to a location you choose).

The Software does not perform:
- Network traffic sniffing.
- Global keyboard recording.
- Continuous background monitoring or hidden data collection.

---

## 4. Purposes of Use
| Data | Purpose | Retention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Selected file paths | Display and processing | Session only |
| Parsed modules/references | Generate analysis reports for your review | In memory, or stored locally only if you export; not uploaded |
| User-entered descriptions/versions | Update `tools_info.json` | Persisted locally in the program directory |
| Exported files (Excel/CSV) | Your optional sharing or archiving | Managed by you |
| Screenshot images | Your usage of captured images | Saved to your chosen local path |

We use data solely to perform the requested local analysis, display results, and generate exports. We do not conduct remote profiling or sell personal data.

---

## 5. Storage & Location
- `tools_info.json`: Stores tool descriptions and changelog; kept in the application directory.
- Exported files: Excel/CSV saved only where you choose.
- Screenshot files: Saved only in locations you select.
- No automatic cloud synchronization is implemented.

---

## 6. Logs & Error Handling
On errors, the Software may output a traceback to the console or runtime window:
- May include technical details (e.g., file paths, module names) for debugging.
- Contains no personal data unless your filenames or paths themselves contain such data.

---

## 7. Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies
The Software may use libraries such as `tkinter`, `json`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`. These libraries do not independently transmit your file contents. If any cloud-based SDKs are added in the future, this Policy will be updated accordingly.

---

## 8. Absent Features (Negative Disclosure)
Unless you modify or extend the Software yourself, it currently:
- Has no user account system.
- Sends no usage metrics to remote servers.
- Integrates no advertising or marketing pushes.
- Performs no auto-update or background network communications (unless added in a future version with disclosure and consent where applicable).

---

## 9. User Control
You can:
- Decide whether to select any files for analysis.
- Decide whether to export reports or save screenshots.
- Edit tool descriptions and version text.
- Delete locally generated artifacts (`tools_info.json`, exported files). Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

---

## 10. Security Measures & Recommendations
- The Software does not automatically encrypt your files; it runs under your current OS user permissions.
- Avoid including highly sensitive or confidential data in demos, exports, or screenshots.
- If you require stronger protection, run the Software on encrypted storage or within a sandboxed environment.

---

## 11. Children’s Privacy
The Software is not directed to children (e.g., under 13). We do not knowingly collect children’s personal data.

---

## 12. International Data Transfers
The Software operates offline by default and does not perform cross-border data transfers. If future versions introduce cloud services, we will update this Policy beforehand.

---

## 13. Changes to This Policy
If major changes are introduced (e.g., remote analytics, account system, cloud sync), we will:
- Update the “Last Updated” date.
- Provide a notice in the tool description (stored in `tools_info.json`) or in the README.

---

## 14. Your Rights
Because the Software does not maintain user accounts or centralized cloud storage:
- Your data exists only on your local environment and can be deleted directly by you.
- There are no remote copies requiring deletion requests.
- If online services are added in the future, we will document how to exercise access, rectification, deletion, and other rights.

---

## 15. Third‑Party Links
If the UI contains links to external sites (documentation, support), those sites’ privacy policies apply. We are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.

---

## 16. Module‑Specific Notes
- CNF Analyzer: Parses only the `.cnf.xml` files you select to extract structure and reference relationships.
- Batch Excel Creation / Excel Comparison: Reads cell data to perform logic and generate results; no content is uploaded.
- Linear Curve: Performs mathematical computations in memory.
- AlarmGroup Cleaning: Edits XML parameter values; ensure files do not contain sensitive personal data.
- Station Screenshot: Creates image files that may capture sensitive information visible on your screen—share with caution.

---

## 17. Disclaimer
This Policy is based on the Software’s current functionality and does not constitute legal advice. If you process sensitive data (e.g., identity, medical, financial), conduct an appropriate compliance review and implement additional safeguards as needed.
